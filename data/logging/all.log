[Rendering-Trace]: Validation Error: [ VUID-VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR-imageExtent-01689 ] | MessageID = 0x13140d69 | vkCreateSwapchainKHR(): pCreateInfo->imageExtent = (120, 0) which is illegal. The Vulkan spec states: imageExtent members width and height must both be non-zero (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.261.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR-imageExtent-01689)
XT structure was not included in the pNext chain, or it is included and VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT::scalingBehavior is zero then imageExtent must be between minImageExtent and maxImageExtent, inclusive, where minImageExtent and maxImageExtent are members of the VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR for the surface (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.261.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR-pNext-07781)
