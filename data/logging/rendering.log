[Rendering-Trace]: Validation Error: [ VUID-VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR-pNext-07781 ] | MessageID = 0x4c8929c1 | vkCreateSwapchainKHR() called with imageExtent = (1280,720), which is outside the bounds returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR(): currentExtent = (1296,759), minImageExtent = (1296,759), maxImageExtent = (1296,759). The Vulkan spec states: If a VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT structure was not included in the pNext chain, or it is included and VkSwapchainPresentScalingCreateInfoEXT::scalingBehavior is zero then imageExtent must be between minImageExtent and maxImageExtent, inclusive, where minImageExtent and maxImageExtent are members of the VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR for the surface (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.261.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR-pNext-07781)
